# wordlist
A simple project I made to exercise with FILE.

## How to run
First you have to compile the source code: \
`gcc main.c -lm -o main`

Then, to run the program correctly, you just have to use these arguments: \
`./main character_list length output_filename`

For example: \
`./main abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 4 worldlist.txt`
